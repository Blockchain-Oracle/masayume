 * The reference's balance pill (`Header.tsx` L296–316): one compact total of the user's money, and a
 * vermilion `+` that opens Add money. It sits LEFT of the address pill and never hides once connected —
 * funding is one tap away at every balance, which is the whole point of it being in the bar.
 *
 * "Never show a half-loaded sum": until the balance sheet has answered, the figure is an em dash, not a
 * zero. The sum is what a bet can actually be paid from — the wallet's spendable plus the Trading Balance —
 * as the reference sums its account and wallet; claimable credit is different money and is not in it.
