/**
 * The app itself, captured on a phone — the reference's `PhoneShot`, frame markup kept exactly.
 *
 * The reference argues for a real capture over a drawing: a drawing shows the app as intended
 * rather than as built. So this is a real capture of `/markets` at a phone viewport, straight off
 * the browser, at `public/app/bet-screen.png` (780×1688 — a 390×844 viewport at 2×, the same
 * 1:2.164 a phone screen has). TO REPLACE: capture again at that viewport and drop it in.
 *
 * One addition, `dl-phone-bar`: a browser capture has no status bar, where a device shot does,
 * so the frame supplies that band above the image and the island sits in a real gap as the
 * reference's comment describes. The band is frame, not app.
