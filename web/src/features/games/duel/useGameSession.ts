 * The key that swipes.
 *
 * Flicky asks a player for no signature per card because every one of its transactions is sponsored.
 * The same promise is kept another way: the entry transaction names a key this browser holds as the
 * seat's agent — and sends it gas in the same call when no sponsor will — and from then on every pick is
 * `placePickFor`, signed by the key and paid for by the player under the allowance the entry took. The
 * key can place picks for one seat of one match, within the deck's own ceiling, until the grant runs out
 * — and nothing else. Losing it loses a duel's convenience, never money.
 *
 * The key itself lives in `useGameKey`, shared by every consumer; this is its signing session, under the
 * `game-session` authority so the journal names which actor sent what.
