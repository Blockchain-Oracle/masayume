/**
 * `/demo` — ported from `reference/yosuku/app/demo/page.tsx`.
 *
 * The reference's structure is kept line for line; every claim is rewritten to what
 * this product actually does on Somnia. Two of its promises do not hold here and are
 * not repeated: bets are not gas-free (the wallet pays STT — there is no sponsor), and
 * there is no native mobile build (the web app installs as a PWA). Nothing here names
 * an X handle; social account setup is described in its own guide.
