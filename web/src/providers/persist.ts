/**
 * The read cache that survives a reload.
 *
 * A hard refresh had no last-good anything: `withReading`'s memory lives for the life of the
 * document, so every returning user paid the full cold chain cost again, and the boot facts
 * alone measured 0.4-2.0 s of that.
 *
 * What is written to disk is a deliberately short list, and the rule is not "what would be
 * nice to have back" but "what can never be wrong about somebody". Every entry here is public,
 * chain-scoped and slowly changing. Nothing account-scoped is written at all — not a balance,
 * not a position, not a history page — so there is no account to purge on disconnect and no
 * way for one wallet's data to be shown to another. That is a stronger guarantee than a purge,
 * because a purge is a thing that can fail to run.
 *
 * Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` whenever a persisted value's shape changes; with the chain id it is
 * the cache buster, and a namespace miss simply reads as "nothing stored".
