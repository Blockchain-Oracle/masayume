/**
 * Reads the arena's parameters, and with `APPLY=1` writes the owner's approved set.
 *
 * Why these numbers (owner's decision, 2026-09-03, measured by `spike:deck-supply`): Somnia supplies two
 * Windows per cadence, and the arena checks card life at reveal — so a 15m Window is only dealable for
 * the part of its cycle that outlasts join + reveal + card life. At `minDeckSize` 3 with 180/120 windows
 * a duel was dealable 40% of the time. A floor of two and tighter windows takes that to 90%.
 *
 * The windows shrink safely because both players are already live on sockets when they are paired — 60
 * seconds to sign a create and a join is generous for someone looking at the screen — and a player who
 * misses it triggers `refundUnjoined`, which returns the pot. The failure is a refund, not a loss.
 *
