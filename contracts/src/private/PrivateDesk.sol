/// @title PrivateDesk — link-private bets on DreamDEX Windows: a budget only its owner can withdraw, a
///        throwaway slot per bet, and a pool in between that neither half names.
/// @notice Ported from Yosuku's `private_budget` module and its executor (`services/private-bet-executor`,
///         context/14 §7). An owner deposits and sets an allowance the desk may spend. A bet is then three
///         transactions from the desk key, never fewer: `chargeToPool` names the owner and an opaque key;
///         `fundSlot` names the slot; `mintInSlot` names the slot and the market. Settlement is permissionless.
///         The way home is the same split in reverse: `sweepSlotToPool` names the slot, `creditFromPool`
///         names the owner and another opaque key. Only the owner's own `withdraw` ever pays out, and only to
///         `msg.sender`. The desk moves an allowance into a bet and a payout back to a balance; a compromised desk
///         key could credit an address of its choosing, so the allowance an owner sets is the blast radius, and the
///         pool it could raid holds only what was just charged or just won.
/// @dev What this is NOT: anonymity. `Charged` and `SlotFunded` land seconds apart for the same figure, and a
///      determined observer can line them up; the desk process sees both halves while it works. The claim of
///      ownership is the desk's signed ticket, held by the owner alone — the chain keeps no owner on any slot.
///      Storage and events carry market ids only (AD-10).
