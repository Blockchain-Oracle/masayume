/// @title GameArena — a two-player duel over real DreamDEX Windows: each card is one confirmed IOC pick,
///        and only the side-pot is the arena's to award.
/// @notice Ported from Flicky's `duel` module (`reference/flicky/apps/contracts/sources/duel.move:123-220`)
///         with one deliberate difference. Flicky settles from keeper-fed prices because its venue has no
///         public settlement read; Masayume redeems each pick through DreamDEX's own module and books the
///         payout the venue paid, so no oracle key sits between a player and their money.
/// @dev The economic spine: a pick's cost and quantity are deltas measured around the IOC, a card's payout
///      is the delta measured around the redemption, and the winner is the greater sum of `payout - cost`.
///      Nothing in this contract prices anything. The pot is the only money it decides.
/// @dev Card settlement is deliberately independent of the pot. A match whose pot was forfeited or refunded
///      still holds two players' real positions, so `settleCard` keeps working in every status past the
///      reveal — losing a pot must never cost a player the market position they paid for.
/// @dev Storage and events carry market ids only (AD-10). Credits pay the player, never the caller (AD-5).
/// @dev The ledger, the refunds and the agent grants live in `ArenaMatches` and `ArenaAgents`; this contract
///      is the trading half — entry, reveal, picks, lock, settlement, the pot.
